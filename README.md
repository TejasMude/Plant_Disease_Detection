# ⭐Plant_Disease_Detection
This repository contains a machine learning-based system for detecting plant diseases from images. Leveraging the power of deep learning, this project aims to assist farmers and agriculturists in identifying various plant diseases early, ensuring timely intervention and better crop management.

# ⭐Features

•Image Classification: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of plant leaves into different disease categories.

•Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts for data augmentation and preprocessing to enhance model performance.

•Model Training: Provides code for training the model on a labeled dataset of plant images.

•Model Evaluation: Contains methods for evaluating model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

•User Interface: Features a simple web-based UI for uploading images and displaying predictions.

•Deployment: Instructions for deploying the model as a web service using Flask or similar frameworks.

# ⭐Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of thousands of labeled images of plant leaves affected by various diseases. This dataset includes:
•Healthy leaves

•Leaves affected by diseases like blight, rust, and mildew

•High-quality, diverse images to ensure robust model performance
